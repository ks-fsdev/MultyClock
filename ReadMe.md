## 🌌 About The Project

MultiClock is a high-performance, full-stack MERN application designed for advanced time management. Built with a cinematic, dark-mode-first aesthetic, it allows users to track multiple independent timers simultaneously using a custom-built reactive SVG orbital engine.

Whether dividing a study session into sub-intervals or managing multiple classroom activities at once, MultiClock provides a distraction-free, visually stunning dashboard.

### ✨ Key Features

- **Orbital SVG Clock:** Visualizes active timers as dynamic, concentric glowing rings that update smoothly in real-time.
- **The "Black Hole" Void:** An ultra-minimalist center display that intelligently tracks and displays the timer closest to finishing.
- **Bifurcated Time Blocks:** Divide your main timers into custom sub-intervals, featuring smooth visual progression bars.
- **Master Override:** A single centralized hub to play or pause all active timers on the dashboard simultaneously.
- **Cinematic UI:** A highly polished "glass-morphism" design with custom monospace typography and tailored Clerk authentication modals.
- **Native Mobile Feel:** Optimized for touchscreens with hidden scrollbars, responsive bottom-sheet modals, and tactile hitboxes.
